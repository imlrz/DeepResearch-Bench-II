# Social Protection in South Asia: Failures and Exclusion of the Ultra-Poor

**Main Takeaway:** Despite extensive social protection schemes across South Asia, fundamental design flaws, elite capture, targeting errors, invisible barriers, and self-exclusion mechanisms combine to systematically exclude the ultra-poor, undermining program efficacy.

## Part One: Program Failures by Country

### India: Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)

The MGNREGA guarantees 100 days of unskilled work annually to rural households but suffers from:

- Chronic underfunding leading to delayed or partial wage payments, dissuading participation and deepening distress among the poorest.[^1]
- Mandatory Aadhaar-based payments creating technical mismatches and excluding workers lacking digital access or correct biometric records.[^2]
- Caste-based discrimination, with Scheduled Castes receiving timely payments only 46% of the time versus 26% for other groups, reflecting local power imbalances and social exclusion.[^1]
- Weak Panchayati Raj Institutions with limited autonomy and capacity, resulting in poor planning, project delays, and low asset quality.[^3][^1]


### Pakistan: Zakat Program

Modeled on Islamic charitable obligations, the state-administered Zakat program faces:

- Sectarian exemptions and politicized administration, with Shia Muslims securing exemption certificates while Sunnis raise concerns about unequal treatment, fostering mistrust and evasion.[^4]
- Exclusion of informal and rural poor due to rigid documentation (e.g., birth certificates), creating a black market for documents and excluding those unable to navigate bureaucratic processes.[^5][^4]
- Low collection efficiency (a fraction of potential 4% GDP) and proclivity for funds to be diverted to politically connected institutions rather than direct cash transfers to needy households.[^5]


### Bangladesh: CFPR-TUP (Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction—Targeting the Ultra-Poor)

BRAC’s two-year graduation program combines asset grants, training, consumption support, and health services. Failures include:

- Premature withdrawal of NGO implementers before full community transition, leaving ultra-poor without institutional support or linkages to formal services.[^6]
- Urban pilot shortcomings, where lack of social cohesion and absence of homestead land hinder project scalability and asset maintenance.[^6]
- Limited impact on health and women’s empowerment despite positive income and food security gains, indicating gaps in complementary services and long-term viability.[^7]


### Nepal: Food Subsidy and Child Grant Programs

#### Nepal Food Corporation Subsidized Rice

- Centralized depots located far from remote villages force the destitute to rely on middlemen with transport means, who resell subsidized rice at high prices, covering only 2% of ultra-poor food needs and generating profits for elites.[^8]


#### Child Grant Programme

- Monthly transfers of Rs 532 per child up to age 5 reach only one-third of eligible children due to narrow targeting, poor outreach, and stigma associated with enrollment processes.[^9]


## Part Two: Categorized Analysis of Failures

### 1. Program Design Flaws

- MGNREGA’s assumption of digital readiness ignores rural infrastructure deficits, causing wage disbursement failures.[^2]
- CFPR-TUP’s fixed two-year timeframe fails to accommodate meso-level constraints like market access and service linkages.[^7]
- Nepal’s Food Corporation design places collection burden on beneficiaries with no last-mile delivery mechanism.[^8]


### 2. Elite Capture

- Zakat Councils, controlled by political parties and religious authorities, allocate funds to favored groups or institutions rather than direct beneficiaries.[^4]
- Middlemen usurp subsidized rice distribution in Nepal, turning a welfare scheme into an income source for the affluent.[^8]


### 3. Targeting Errors

- CFPR-TUP type-I errors exclude households that meet ultra-poor criteria, reducing overall impact on the intended poorest deciles.[^7]
- India’s caste data inaccuracies in job cards lead to eligible non-SC/ST households being mistakenly denied work opportunities.[^1]
- Pakistan’s zakat eligibility hinges on Sahib-e-Nisab calculations that omit modern assets, excluding many needy households who own informal or unassessed wealth.[^5]


### 4. Invisible Barriers

- Lack of identity documents bars South Asian ultra-poor from enrolling in cash transfer and health insurance schemes.[^4]
- Gender norms prevent women from traveling to centralized distribution points for MGNREGA work or food subsidies, limiting female participation.[^8]
- Hidden costs (transport, application fees) create financial disincentives to access ostensibly free benefits in all four countries.[^1][^8]


### 5. Self-Exclusion by the Poor

- Stigma around targeted assistance deters eligible households from applying, as documented in Nepal’s Child Grant take-up.[^9]
- MGNREGA’s delayed wages and quality concerns lead the poorest to avoid participation, preferring irregular informal labor.[^1]
- Ultra-poor households decline CFPR-TUP enrollment when they perceive public visibility may threaten local support networks.[^6]


## Summary Table of Main Social Protection Programs

| Country | Program Name | Program Type | Program Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| India | MGNREGA | Employment Guarantee | Guarantees 100 days of unskilled rural work per household annually to improve livelihoods and assets. |
| Pakistan | Zakat Program | Religious Cash Transfer | Compulsory 2.5% wealth deduction for eligible Muslims, redistributed via Zakat Councils to the needy. |
| Bangladesh | CFPR-TUP | Graduation Model | Two-year program providing asset grants, skills training, consumption support, and health assistance. |
| Nepal | Nepal Food Corporation Subsidized Rice | Food Subsidy | Provides heavily subsidized rice through central depots to low-income households. |
| Nepal | Child Grant Programme | Conditional Cash Transfer | Monthly transfer for children under 5 to reduce child labor and improve nutrition and health outcomes. |

This analysis highlights pervasive systemic barriers undermining South Asian social protection, necessitating redesigns that address administrative inefficiencies, power imbalances, and the lived realities of the ultra-poor.
